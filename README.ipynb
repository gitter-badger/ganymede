    "Have you also wondered where the fourth Galilean moon in [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org)'s logo has gone? Well, it is told that after many centuries of Ganymede's absence from Mount Olympus, Zeus felt a deep and painful longing. So he sent out his eagle again to find Ganymede and bring him back. But Ganymede always wanted to be more than just a servant for the pleasure of the gods. He turned to Jupyter with an offer. If Jupyter grant him shelter in his giant atmosphere then Ganymede would build him a new temple. A temple to attract a whole new generation of worshippers. Jupyter accepted..."
